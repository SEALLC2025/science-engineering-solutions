  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    With more than a decade of academic research in microplastics and emerging 
    chemicals of concern, we witnessed firsthand the growing challenges faced by industry 
    and by water and wastewater utilities in addressing microplastic pollution and its
    potential impacts on water and food safety. As regulatory interest intensified and the 
    need for reliable analytical methods increased, it became clear that a gap existed 
    between cutting-edge scientific knowledge and the practical tools available to 
    environmental professionals and industries.
